Developed an audio plug-in with `graphical interface (GUI)` with C++ and JUCE Framework. This project aims to facilitate my needs regarding my interest in audio engineering.

## Functionalities
### 1. Graphical interface:
Interactive user interface with cool background.

### 2. Gain adjustement:
Adjustable gain control

### 3. High-pass filter:
Efficient digital signal processing algorithm to remove low-frequency audio signals. It features an adjustable cutoff frequency enabling users to tailor the filter response to suit different mixing needs.

### 4. Compressor:
Compressor designed for dynamic range control, it features ratio and threshold settings, allowing users to fine-tune the ammount of gain reduction applied to the signal.

### 5. Delay Effect:
Delay effect implemented using a finite impulse response (FIR) filter with adjustable delay time.
